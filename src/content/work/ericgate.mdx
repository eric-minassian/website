# ericgate

[github](https://github.com/eric-minassian/ericgate)

An API for serving private files from static sites.

<AccessFlow client:load />

## Problem

Static sites can't serve private content. You either make files public or build a backend. There's no simple API to gate access to files with approval workflows.

## Solution

Upload files, define access rules, integrate via API. Your static site calls the API with a user token—if approved, it gets a signed CloudFront URL. You control who gets access through a dashboard or API.

Built with React, Rust Lambda, Smithy for type-safe client/server codegen, and AWS CDK.
