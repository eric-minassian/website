# aws-tanstack-query

[github](https://github.com/eric-minassian/aws-tanstack-query) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-tanstack-query)

Generate type-safe [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) options from any Smithy-generated TypeScript client.

<CodeTransform client:load />

## Problem

Using Smithy clients in React with TanStack Query means writing boilerplate for every operation: query keys, client wrappers, types. This library generates it all by reading the Smithy model embedded in the client package.

## Solution

Point it at any Smithy-generated TypeScript client—AWS SDKs or your own—and get typed `queryOptions`, `mutationOptions`, and a query key factory.
