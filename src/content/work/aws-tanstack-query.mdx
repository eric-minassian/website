# aws-tanstack-query

[github](https://github.com/eric-minassian/aws-tanstack-query) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-tanstack-query)

Generate type-safe [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) options from AWS SDK v3 clients.

<CodeTransform client:load />

## Problem

Using AWS services in React with TanStack Query means writing boilerplate for every operation: query keys, SDK wrappers, types. This library generates it all from the Smithy model embedded in AWS SDK clients.

## Solution

Point it at an SDK package, get typed `queryOptions`, `mutationOptions`, and a query key factory. Works with any AWS service.
