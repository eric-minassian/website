Personal finance tracking that runs in your browser.

<SyncDiagram client:load />

## Problem

Finance apps want your data on their servers. Desktop apps don't sync. You shouldn't have to choose between privacy and convenience.

## Solution

SQLite compiled to WebAssembly runs in your browser. Data stays local. Optional sync encrypts the database client-side before uploading—the server never sees plaintext.

Built with React, sql.js, Drizzle ORM, and AWS for hosting/sync.
