# work

[by eric minassian](/)

I'm a software engineer with experience building scalable systems and working on impactful products.

## Amazon

I currently work at [Amazon](https://amazon.com) on [Project Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper), Amazon's initiative to launch a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband connectivity to unserved and underserved communities around the world.

## Walmart Global Tech

Previously, I worked at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com), where I contributed to building and maintaining systems that serve millions of customers daily.

## Education

I'm pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Business Administration at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu). This combination has given me both the technical foundation to build software and the business acumen to understand the broader context of the products I work on.
