# Eric Minassian

I'm a software engineer at [Amazon](https://amazon.com), working on [Project Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper) — Amazon's initiative to provide fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities worldwide through a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites.

Previously, I worked at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com) as a software engineer.

I'm currently finishing my studies in Computer Science and Business Administration at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu).

I enjoy building things, learning about distributed systems, and exploring new technologies. When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading, playing chess, or working on side projects.
