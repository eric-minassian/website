# Eric Minassian

I'm a software engineer at [Amazon](https://amazon.com), working on [Amazon Leo](https://leo.amazon.com) — Amazon's initiative to provide fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities worldwide through a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites.

Previously at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com), I built payments software deployed across all 4,600+ U.S. stores to help get associates paid.

I studied Computer Science and Business Administration at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu), graduating summa cum laude.
